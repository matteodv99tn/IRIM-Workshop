This workshop will explore how next-generation smart robots are driving the evolution of Industry 5.0 by bringing humans back to the center of industrial production through effective human-robot collaboration. 
Moving beyond safety certification and simple coexistence, the workshop will delve into cutting-edge advances in perception, control, and motion planning that are crucial for deploying collaborative robots in real-world industrial environments.

The program will feature keynote talks by established researchers, innovative startup founders, and experts from industrial-focused research centers, providing a rich blend of academic insights and industry-driven perspectives.
Topics will include:

- Stability and passivity for safe robot control in physical human-robot interaction
- Human-aware motion prediction and planning for shared workspaces
- Shared autonomy and adaptive control to balance human expertise with robotic consistency
- Learning from demonstration to boost productivity and flexibility on the factory floor
- Advanced sensing systems and algorithms for smart manufacturing
- Reinforcement learning and large behavioral models for next-generation task planning and allocation

Attendees will gain a comprehensive overview of the latest developments that are shaping the smart factories of tomorrow, as well as practical challenges in translating these technologies from laboratory research to industrial deployment.
